## Thesis
Stepping into your local bookstore, you spot a gallery of classic books ‚Äì You recognize them from their striking colors: Black, White, and Orange; Typesetted with born modern and traditional design. Like notetaking, they exist in two worlds: The sentimental and the scientific.

## Coming Soon (In Development)
* UI (Status, Scroll-bar, and Buttons etc.).
* Plugin Interactions with Hider, Minimal System Settings, and Style Settings.
* More...

## Maintenance

This is my first theme and will be updated as I learn best-practices. If you want to help, don't hesitate in asking!  

## Features

* Minimal borders for simplicity.
* Two fonts: Technical for UI, traditional for note-taking.
* Trichromatic, but large scales for each colour adding dynamism.
